# Readme
Jupyter notebooks used to generate figures for publication 'Flawed Emergency Intervention: Slow Ocean Response to Abrupt Stratospheric Aerosol Injection'. The notebooks were run on the [Dutch supercomputer Snellius](https://www.surf.nl/en/dutch-national-supercomputer-snellius) where our simulation data is stored. Some post-processed example data is found in `./data` but the full simulation output is only available on Snellius, for now. The notebooks contain cell output that verify all individual steps.

The notebooks methods from our [CESM2 toolbox](https://github.com/daniel-pflueger/cesm_tools).
